# Reddit Educational Clone made with Next.js + Tailwind CSS

This project shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.2)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

This is just a demo to demonstrate the capabilities with Next.js with tailWind CSS along with the following technologies:

- [Heroicons](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons)
- [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example): Users can login the app using their reddit account.
- [Reddit provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/reddit).
- [Supabase](www.supabase.com) postgresql database.
- [Stepzen & Graphql](https://stepzen.com/) to access and interact with the postgreSQL database through graphql.
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-client/next-js/next-js-getting-started/) to manage data data with graphql from the react app.
- [React-Hook](https://react-hook-form.com/) which is a hook that allows us to optimize the form management by reducing the amount of code needed to write while removing unnecessary re-renders.
- [React-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/docs) which brings beautiful notifications and easy to use functionality in our React app.
- [UI ball Loaders](https://uiball.com/loaders/) which provides free loaders and spinners when we want to wait for asynchronous processes.

## Disclaimer

This is just a demo project with the intention of test and practice with the latest Next.js framework feactures for React.
